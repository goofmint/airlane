## Auto re-deply

When you edit server-side JavaScript code, Airlane immediately reflects it. You don't need to restart server by hands.

## Auto generate client-side JavaScript and Stylesheet

Airlane supports ECMA2016 JavaScript on Web browser. It's convert to ECMA5 by babel. And Airlane provides browserify, so you can use npm module in your client JavaScript code. Normarl JavaScript code is generated by Airlane automatically. Your JavaScript locates to *hello/routes/public/app.js*, and converted file locales to *hello/routes/public/app.min.js*. This JavaScript file is loaded by HTML file in *hello/routes/views/layout.jade*, so you don't need care about it.

Airlane supports load stylesheet file in npm package, too. It's limited feature, but it supports bootstrap. If you want to use bootstrap, execute command first.

```
npm install bootstrap --save
```

And you write a line in your stylesheet file located *hello/routes/public/app.css*

```
@import bootstrap;
```

Your stylesheet file *hello/routes/public/app.min.css* will update soon with bootstrap stylesheet.
